# MonPy
**MonPy** is a command line based system monitoring tool. It allows you to
monitor your CPU and GPU temperatures.

You can view these temperatures in real time printed as a nice looking graphs
whose theme you can change. 

You can also write these changes in to a `.csv` file for later to be used
together with, for example a spreadsheet software so you can better visualize
the recorded data.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project **only works with Linux**, AMD CPUs which are compatible
> with the `k10temp` kernel driver and nvidia cards with the proprietary
> drivers, as of right now.

Support for other hardware and platforms is not planned as this was my [cs50p final project](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/project/).
